# Implementation Notes

This document provides an overview of the AG Trial Plot Planning application implementation based on the technical requirements.

## Architecture and Structure

The application is built using Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses a database schema defined in Prisma that matches the requirements in the database-design document.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Authentication**
   - Google SSO integration
   - Microsoft SSO integration
   - Demo login mechanism for development and testing
   - Role-based access control (admin, researcher, field-technician)

2. **Dashboard**
   - Overview of trials, observations, and activities
   - Role-specific content and actions

3. **Trial Management**
   - List view of all trials
   - Mock trial data for demonstration

4. **Observation Collection**
   - Structured data collection interface
   - List of pending and completed observations

5. **Field Navigation**
   - Trial and plot selection
   - Route optimization options (distance-based or priority-based)
   - Mock map interface (to be replaced with Leaflet)

6. **User Management (Admin)**
   - List of users with roles and organization memberships
   - User management actions (add, edit, deactivate)

7. **Settings**
   - Profile information
   - Display and language preferences
   - Synchronization options for offline mode
   - Data storage configuration
   - Device settings

### Database Design

The Prisma schema implements the database design from the technical requirements, with tables for:
- Users and authentication
- Organizations and memberships
- Trials and plots
- Treatments
- Observation protocols and metrics
- Observations and values
- Navigation and route planning
- Weather data
- Equipment integration
- Synchronization logs

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Generate Prisma client:
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or use the provided script:
   ```
   ./start.sh
   ```

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Authentication Configuration

Before deploying to production, configure the following:

1. Set up OAuth credentials in Google and Microsoft developer consoles
2. Update the .env file with your credentials:
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID
   - MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET
   - MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID (optional)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (for JWT encryption)

## Next Steps

1. **Database Connection**: Configure PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
2. **Fully Implement Map Interface**: Complete the Leaflet integration for interactive maps
3. **API Routes**: Develop RESTful API endpoints for data operations
4. **Full CRUD Operations**: Complete the Create, Update, and Delete functionality
5. **Offline Synchronization**: Implement the full offline capability
6. **Weather Integration**: Connect to weather APIs for environmental data
7. **Equipment Integration**: Add interfaces for field measurement devices
8. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Configure for installation on mobile devices
