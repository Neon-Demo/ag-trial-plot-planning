[THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER FILE]

Due to tool limitations, I cannot directly download and replace the hero image with an actual image file.

The real image that should replace the existing hero-image.jpg needs to be:
- A high-quality photo showing agricultural researchers collecting data in a field trial
- Placed at /project/public/hero-image.jpg
- Properly licensed for use on the website

Please refer to hero-image.jpg.instructions for complete details on the required image.
