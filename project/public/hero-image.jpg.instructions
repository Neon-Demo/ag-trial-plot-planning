To update the hero image, please download a new image showing agricultural field trials with researchers collecting data from experimental plots. The image should:

1. Show researchers or agricultural scientists in a field trial setting
2. Depict people actively collecting data or examining crops in trial plots
3. Be high resolution (at least 1200px wide)
4. Have good lighting and clear visibility of the agricultural trial setting
5. Replace the current hero-image.jpg file in the /project/public directory

I've already updated the code in page.tsx to properly display the new hero image using the Next.js Image component with appropriate dimensions and alt text.

Recommended image sources:
- Stock photo sites like Pexels, Unsplash, or Shutterstock
- Agricultural research databases with proper licensing
- Your own organization's field trial photographs

After downloading the new image, rename it to hero-image.jpg and place it in the /project/public directory.
