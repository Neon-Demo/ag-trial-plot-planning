# Implementation Notes for Development

This document contains key technical information and implementation details for developers working on the Agricultural Trial Plot Planning mobile application.

## Authentication

### Google & Microsoft OAuth Configuration

1. **Google Auth Configuration**:
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in `src/core/auth/AuthService.ts` with actual Google OAuth client ID
   - Configure your Google OAuth application with the redirect URI: `agtrialplanner://`
   - Required scopes: `profile`, `email`

2. **Microsoft Auth Configuration**:
   - Replace `YOUR_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` in `src/core/auth/AuthService.ts` with actual Microsoft OAuth client ID
   - Configure your Microsoft Azure application with the redirect URI: `agtrialplanner://`
   - Required scopes: `profile`, `email`, `openid`

3. **Demo Mode**:
   - The `demoUser` in `AuthService.ts` can be updated with appropriate test data
   - For production, this should be disabled or limited by environment

## Offline Data Synchronization

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Data Priority Levels**:
   - Critical: User data, active trials, current plots (synced immediately when connection available)
   - Standard: Historical observations, images (synced during scheduled sync)
   - Low: Deleted items, old trials (synced when manually triggered or during maintenance)

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Server timestamps determine precedence in case of conflicts
   - User is prompted for manual resolution in cases of direct conflicts
   - Implement the Operational Transformation algorithm for advanced conflict resolution

3. **Queue Processing**:
   - Background processing of sync queue using `processOfflineQueue()` in `ApiClient.ts`
   - Retry strategy with exponential backoff for failed requests
   - Batch sync operations when possible to reduce API calls

## Performance Optimization

### Large Dataset Handling

1. **Pagination**:
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists using windowing techniques
   - Only render visible items in the viewport with `FlashList` for better performance

2. **Image Processing**:
   - Compress images before storage and transmission
   - Progressive image loading for thumbnails and previews
   - Implement a local cache cleanup policy for image storage

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Index database fields for frequent queries 
   - Use batch operations for multiple inserts/updates
   - Implement lazy loading for relationships (e.g., load observation values only when viewing an observation)

## Geospatial Features

### Map Implementation

1. **Map Rendering**:
   - Use React Native Maps with offline map tiles
   - Cache map tiles for common field areas
   - Implement custom GeoJSON rendering for plot boundaries

2. **Location Tracking**:
   - Optimize location services for battery usage with adaptive polling rates
   - Implement geofencing for plot boundaries to trigger notifications
   - Store location history for route tracking and statistics

3. **Route Optimization**:
   - Implement A* algorithm for path finding between plots
   - Consider terrain difficulty and physical barriers in route calculation
   - Support custom constraints (e.g., follow trial blocks, snake pattern, etc.)

## UI/UX Considerations

### Field-Specific Design

1. **Sunlight Visibility**:
   - Implement high-contrast mode for bright outdoor conditions
   - Use color schemes suitable for all lighting conditions
   - Font sizes should be sufficient for viewing at arm's length

2. **One-Handed Operation**:
   - Place primary actions within thumb reach
   - Implement swipe gestures for common operations
   - Support voice commands for hands-free operation

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - Confirm destructive actions with clear warnings
   - Auto-save form data to prevent loss
   - Provide clear validation feedback

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **SQLite Constraints**:
   - Maximum database size limited to device storage
   - Complex queries can cause performance issues on older devices
   - Implement pagination and query optimization

2. **Authentication Edge Cases**:
   - Token refresh handling needs improvement
   - Offline authentication timeout handling
   - SSO integration with enterprise identity providers may require custom solutions

3. **Device Compatibility**:
   - GPS accuracy varies by device
   - Camera quality affects image analysis capabilities
   - Battery optimization differs across manufacturers

## Development Roadmap

### Upcoming Features

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**:
   - Basic authentication (Google, Microsoft, Demo)
   - Trial and plot viewing
   - Simple observations with offline support
   - Basic map navigation

2. **Phase 2 (Field Ready)**:
   - Complete offline functionality
   - Advanced observation forms
   - Image capture and annotation
   - Route optimization

3. **Phase 3 (Enhanced)**:

   - Equipment connectivity
   - AR plot visualization
   - Advanced analytics and reporting

### Technical Debt to Address

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Extract reusable form components
   - Improve test coverage
   - Refactor database access for better separation of concerns

2. **Performance**:
   - Optimize SQLite queries
   - Implement selective data synchronization
   - Improve render performance for large lists

3. **API Integration**:
   - Standardize error handling
   - Implement robust retry logic
   - Add comprehensive request/response logging
